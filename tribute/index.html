        Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in the village of Banga
        near Lyallpur district in Punjab, British India. He was an Indian
        freedom fighter who is considered to be one of the most influential
        revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. Bhagat Singh joined
        the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) at a young age and became
        involved in revolutionary activities. He participated in several acts of
        sabotage against British institutions, including an attempt to bomb the
        Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. In 1929, he and two other
        activists were convicted of assassinating John Saunders, a British
        police officer. Singh was executed by hanging on March 23, 1931, at
        Lahore jail at the age of 23. Despite his short life, Bhagat Singh left
        a lasting legacy in the struggle for Indian independence. He is revered
        by many as a martyr and symbol of resistance to British colonialism in
        India. His example continues to inspire new generations of activists
        worldwide.
